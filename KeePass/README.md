KeePass2 Source Code Mirror
===========================

This is a source code mirror repository from the open source project 
[KeePass 2.x](http://keepass.info/). It is manually maintained by 
@dleck and it sees one big submit with every new released version of KeePass 2.x sources. 

As its author, Dominik Reichl, [chose not to maintain a public repository] (https://sourceforge.net/p/keepass/discussion/329220/thread/02383c83/?page=0)
this is the closest you'll get to that. :)
