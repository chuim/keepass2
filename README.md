KeePass2 Source Code Mirror Repository
======================================

This is a mirror repository from the open source project 
[KeePass 2.x](http://keepass.info/). It is manually maintained by 
@dleck and it receives one big submit with every new released version of the 
KeePass 2.x sources. 

As the project's author, Dominik Reichl, [chose not to maintain a public repository]
(https://sourceforge.net/p/keepass/discussion/329220/thread/02383c83/?page=0)
with the source, this is the closest you'll get to having one.
